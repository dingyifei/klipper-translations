"Klipper is somewhat of a packaging anomaly among python programs, as it "
"doesn't use setuptools to build and install. Some notes regarding how best "
"to package it are as follows:"

msgid "C modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper uses a C module to handle some kinematics calculations more quickly."
" This module needs to be compiled at packaging time to avoid introducing a "
"runtime dependency on a compiler. To compile the C module, run `python2 "
"klippy/chelper/__init__.py`."

msgid "Compiling python code"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many distributions have a policy of compiling all python code before "
"packaging to improve startup time. You can do this by running `python2 -m "
"compileall klippy`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Versioning"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are building a package of Klipper from git, it is usual practice not "
"to ship a .git directory, so the versioning must be handled without git. To "
"do this, use the script shipped in `scripts/make_version.py` which should be"
" run as follows: `python2 scripts/make_version.py YOURDISTRONAME > "
"klippy/.version`."

msgid "Sample packaging script"

msgid ""
"klipper-git is packaged for Arch Linux, and has a PKGBUILD (package build "
"script) available at "
