"This document describes Filament Width Sensor host module. Hardware used for"
" developing this host module is based on TSL1401CL linear sensor array but "
"it can work with any sensor array that has analog output. You can find "
"designs at "
"[thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=filament%20width%20sensor)"

msgid "How does it work?"
msgstr "它如何运作？"

msgid ""
"Sensor generates analog output based on calculated filament width. Output "
"voltage always equals to detected filament width (Ex. 1.65v, 1.70v, 3.0v). "
"Host module monitors voltage changes and adjusts extrusion multiplier."

"Sensor readings done with 10 mm intervals by default. If necessary you are "
"free to change this setting by editing ***MEASUREMENT_INTERVAL_MM*** "
"parameter in **filament_width_sensor.py** file."

msgid ""
"**QUERY_FILAMENT_WIDTH** - Return the current measured filament width as "
"result **RESET_FILAMENT_WIDTH_SENSOR** – Clear all sensor readings. Can be "
"used after filament change. **DISABLE_FILAMENT_WIDTH_SENSOR** – Turn off the"
" filament width sensor and stop using it to do flow control "
"**ENABLE_FILAMENT_WIDTH_SENSOR** - Turn on the filament width sensor and "
"start using it to do flow control"
